# Scraping-Glasses-Shop

Instructions from Udemy course:

This time your job is to scrape all the available glasses from this website 'https://www.glassesshop.com/bestsellers'.

We're interested in getting the 'product url', 'product image link', 'product name' and the 'product price'.

Please note, at the bottom we do have the pagination so make sure to handle that too.

Path to Spider:
Scraping-Glasses-Shop > glasses_shop > spiders > bestsellers.py

Path to JSON data:
Scraping-Glasses-Shop > bestsellers_data.json
